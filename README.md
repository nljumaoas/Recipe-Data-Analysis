# My Project Title

## Introduction

This will be an analysis of '30-minute' recipes from food.com. While all recipes from the dataset are accompanied
by a listed preparation time, not all recipes with a listed preparation time of 30 minutes or less are tagged with
the '30-minutes-or-less' tag. As such, this project will endeavor to determine whether there is a significant
difference in rating among tagged and untagged recipes with sub-30-minute listed preparation times.

## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |
